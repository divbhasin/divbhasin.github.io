I studied Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and graduated in 2022.
I am currently working at Datadog as a Software Engineer. My job involves
working on coordination primitives like distributed locking and leader
election.

In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, rock climbing,
calisthenics, listening to music, and gaming.
